C# implementation of score table
This is s sample project for interview.
The task was to develop library function for displaying table.

1. assumptions:
	Author assumed that managed code was asked. Otherwise a simple straightfoward C code .dll would be sufficient :)

2. C# and Windows forms platform has been chosen for implementation as the author times ago developed some small applications using this platform.
	No unit testing has been performed as the author has only "managerial" knowledge about it.
	Instead a almost complete manual testing app has been programmed which of course could be extended to full test utility.
During adding deleting the index column is inconsistent. The intent was to have unique identifier for each added match. Not implemented yet. This would need some thinking and additional work.

3.The game table is implemented in ScoreData.CS file only. Its pretty trivial. However the test environment was weekend work /not whole/.

4. CHATGPT has been used as asistant to create empty framework as the author is doing a proof of concept about how this framework increase productivity.
